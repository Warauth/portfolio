#### Where do I begin, the part where I was wondering what I was going to do for this assignment, <br> or when I figured out the due date was three days earlier than I thought it was?
#### Alright then, due date it is.
##### So, I was over at a friend's house on Sunday night. Super Bowl Sunday - always one of the most fun nights of the year, even if you're <br> not a football fan, since the commercials always seems to be more popular than the game itself.

##### I was talking to friends about my assignments that were coming up, one of which was a portfolio for my Web Programming class, <br> and I had decided that I should probably check when my portfolio is due while I had the thought in my head, and I would probably forget <br> afterwards if I didn't look at it now.
##### I pulled out my phone, checked my professors website, and lo and behold:
### Due date: Feb. 6, 2017, 15:00:00.
##### I began to freak out for a few seconds, until I realized that we had been setting up a basic website since class started, which calmed me down a bit. <br> I had made up in my mind that I would have a good night with my friends, and just wake up an hour early to work on it. Surely, I could wake up an hour early, right?
### Wrong.
##### Fortunately, I still woke up with enough time to spare to get most of the blog done before my classes started.
##### As I write this, I'm waiting for class, so I'll wrap up this post here with a short summary of my portfolio-building adventure:
##### Honestly, I found this to be pretty fun, and also easy to do since we had set most of the website up beforehand. All that was <br> left was a little blog post and some pages that I had to make and fill with information.
##### I'm still excited for our semester projects, and can't wait to see which one I get assigned this afternoon.
