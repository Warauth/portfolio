Super Bowl Sunday - always one of the most fun nights of the year, even if you’re &lt;br /&gt; not a football fan, since the commercials always seems to be more popular than the game itself.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;i-was-talking-to-friends-about-my-assignments-that-were-coming-up-one-of-which-was-a-portfolio-for-my-web-programming-class--and-i-had-decided-that-i-should-probably-check-when-my-portfolio-is-due-while-i-had-the-thought-in-my-head-and-i-would-probably-forget--afterwards-if-i-didnt-look-at-it-now&quot;&gt;I was talking to friends about my assignments that were coming up, one of which was a portfolio for my Web Programming class, &lt;br /&gt; and I had decided that I should probably check when my portfolio is due while I had the thought in my head, and I would probably forget &lt;br /&gt; afterwards if I didn’t look at it now.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;i-pulled-out-my-phone-checked-my-professors-website-and-lo-and-behold&quot;&gt;I pulled out my phone, checked my professors website, and lo and behold:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;due-date-feb-6-2017-150000&quot;&gt;Due date: Feb. 6, 2017, 15:00:00.&lt;/h3&gt;

Surely, I could wake up an hour early, right?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrong&quot;&gt;Wrong.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;fortunately-i-still-woke-up-with-enough-time-to-spare-to-get-most-of-the-blog-done-before-my-classes-started&quot;&gt;Fortunately, I still woke up with enough time to spare to get most of the blog done before my classes started.&lt;/h5&gt;

All that was &lt;br /&gt; left was a little blog post and some pages that I had to make and fill with information.&lt;/h5&gt;

Alright then, due date it is.
So, I was over at a friend’s house on Sunday night. Super Bowl Sunday - always one of the most fun nights of the year, even if you’re  not a football fan, since the commercials always seems to be more popular than the game itself.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2017/01/23/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2017-01-23T15:09:41-06:00</published><updated>2017-01-23T15:09:41-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2017/01/23/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2017/01/23/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
